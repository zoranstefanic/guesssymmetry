## Post-install steps

Please take the following steps before you begin to use your Django
installation:

1. Connect your Django application to a site route in the control panel.

2. Edit /home/huk/apps/guessymmetry/myproject/myproject/settings.py to set ALLOWED_HOSTS
   to include your site's domains. Example:

       ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['domain.com', 'www.domain.com']

3. Run the following commands to restart your Django instance:

   /home/huk/apps/guessymmetry/stop
   /home/huk/apps/guessymmetry/start

## Using your own project

If you want to serve your own Django project from this instance:

1. Upload your project directory to /home/huk/apps/guessymmetry

2. Activate the app's environment:

       source /home/huk/apps/guessymmetry/env/bin/activate

3. Install your project's Python dependencies with pip.

4. Edit /home/huk/apps/guessymmetry/uwsgi.ini to point `wsgi-file` and `touch-reload` at your project's WSGI handler

5. Run the following commands to restart your Django instance:

   /home/huk/apps/guessymmetry/stop
   /home/huk/apps/guessymmetry/start
